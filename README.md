# Rust Mini Projects

This repository is a collection of small Rust projects designed to help me learn and practice Rust programming. Each project focuses on different aspects of the language, from basic syntax to more advanced concepts like concurrency, error handling, and ownership.


## Getting Started

To get started with these projects, you'll need to have Rust installed on your machine. If you haven't installed Rust yet, you can do so by following the instructions on the [official Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

### Cloning the Repository

First, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Jalever/rust-mini-projects.git
cd rust-mini-projects
```

### Running a Project

Each project is located in the `src/bin/` directory. To run a specific project, use the following command:

```bash
cargo run --bin project1
```

Replace `project1` with the name of the project you want to run.

### Running Tests

To run the tests for a specific project, navigate to the project directory and use the following command:

```bash
cargo test
```

### Building the Projects

To build all the projects, use the following command:

```bash
cargo build
```
